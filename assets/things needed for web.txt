Rashidat in arabic

dear Guided One, 

i was estatic from the first day i met you, but i was not surprised because you were so special and beautiful
like the night you shine but you still display that calm and elegance, not to reiterate the fact that you were 
in pain that night from something i cant explain but as i saw you i didnt see the pain but i had to hear about the pain form Bimbo. 
"hello Rashidat" 
at this point i was so interested to know the person that bore such beautiful name as proceed with bimbo, "Beaurifull, this is the most beautiful guy in my platoon"
as Bimbo articulated these statement with an smile towards you i just knew that i had to be a very fine guy still feeling myself as i walked towards her within a split 
second i was blinded that i had to compose myself even after the little attitude i was still left in awe. And lost hope when i heard Bimbo say "rashidat will be 
leaving me in this camp alone, i don't know to do." 
to my greatest surprise i saw around some more i was shocked but i was not too focused, i asked bimbo bu she said that you decided t stay with her for some days then
i greet you some more as we exchange casual greetings and you smiled so gorgeously and passed by, there was this time you came so close i felt like pulling you back
and just presenting my bowels to you but it didnt seem right. 
if i must be honest you really are above my level i thpught to myself, so i relaxed and thought destiny would let me slide and low and behold here we are. 
i wish to continue this story part 2 soon.
i didnt get to woo you because you wooed me even without knowing me well enough.
But be rest assured with me everyday you will be made to be the most importnat thing on earth of which you are to me already.  
Just so you know with every time i will tell this story, i will always be refine it with some new features and new words to descibe your elegance and beauty my Love,
you are a rare being i cant afford to loose and im not worthy enough to have but some how you love me and sometimes it baffules me to say the least.
I love you Rasshidat Adejoke Ahmed
